[Intro] Am

[Verse male]
    From the dusty May sun 
    Her looming shadow grows 
    Hidden in the branches 
    of the poison creosote 

    She twines her spines up slowly 
    Towards the boiling sun 
    And when I touched her skin 
    My fingers ran with blood 

[Verse female]
    In the hushing dusk 
    Under a swollen silver moon 
    I came walking with the wind 
    To watch the cactus bloom 

    And strange hands halted me, 
    The looming shadows danced 
    I fell down to the thorny brush 
    And felt the trembling hands 

[Verse]
  [male]
    When the last light warms the rocks 
    And the rattlesnakes unfold 
  [female]
    Mountain cats will come 
    to drag away your bones 
  [both]
    And rise with me forever 
    Across the silent sand 
    And the stars will be your eyes 
    And the wind will be my hands
