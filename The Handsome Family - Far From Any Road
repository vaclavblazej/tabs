From the dusty May sun 
Her looming shadow grows 
Hidden in the branches 
of the poison creosote 

She twines her spines up slowly 
Towards the boiling sun 
And when I touched her skin 
My fingers ran with blood 

In the hushing dusk 
Under a swollen silver moon 
I came walking with the wind 
To watch the cactus bloom 

And strange hands halted me, 
The looming shadows danced 
I fell down to the thorny brush 
And felt the trembling hands 

When the last light warms the rocks 
And the rattlesnakes unfold 
Mountain cats will come 
to drag away your bones 

And rise with me forever 
Across the silent sand 
And the stars will be your eyes 
And the wind will be my hands
