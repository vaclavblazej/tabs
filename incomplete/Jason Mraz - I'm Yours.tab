capo 4

[Verse]
    Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
    I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
    I fell right through the cracks
    And now I'm trying to get back

    Before the cool done run out
    I'll be giving it my best-est
    And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
    I reckon it's again my turn

[Chorus]
    To win some or learn some
    But I won't hesitate no more, no more
    It cannot wait, I'm yours
    Well open up your mind and see like me

[Verse]
    Open up your plans and damn you're free
    Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
    Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
    We are just one big family

    And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved
    So I won't hesitate no more, no more
    It cannot wait I'm sure
    There's no need to complicate

[Chorus]
    Our time is short
    This is our fate, I'm yours
    I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
    And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer

    But my breath fogged up the glass
    And so I drew a new face and I laughed
    I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason
    To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons

    It's what we aim to do
    Our name is our virtue
    But I won't hesitate no more, no more
    It cannot wait I'm yours

    Well open up your mind and see like me
    Open up your plans and damn you're free
    Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours
    So please don't please don't please don't

    There's no need to complicate
    'Cause our time is short
    This, oh this, this is our fate, I'm yours
