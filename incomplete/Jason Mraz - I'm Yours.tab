capo 4

[Intro] G D Em C

[Verse 1]
         G
    Well you done done me an' you bet I felt it
      D
    I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
      Em
    I fell right through the cracks
                C
    And now I'm tryin' to get back

           G
    Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin it my bestest
        D
    and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
      Em
    I reckon it's again my turn
       C
    To win some or learn some

[Chorus]
        G           D
    But I won't hesitate
                Em
    No more, no more
              C            G   D   Em   C
    It cannot wait; I'm yours

[Verse 2]
    G                                    D
    Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                       Em
    Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                         C
    Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love

    G                                               D                                Em
    Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
                                          C                           A7
    And it's our god-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

[Chorus]
    G              D  Dsus4
    So I won't hesitate
                Em
    No more, no more
              C
    It cannot wait, I'm sure
               G             D
    There's no need to complicate
                Em
    Our time is short
                C
    This is our fate,
             G
    I'm yours

[Bridge]
    G                     D             Em
    Doo do do doo doo do, doo do doo do doo do
                           D               C
    Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
                           A7
    And I will nibble your ear

| G  Bm  | Em  D  | C     | A7    |

[Verse 3]
                       |
    I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
        |
    And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
        |
    But my breath fogged up the glass
             |
    And so I drew a new face and I laughed
      |
    I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
       |
    To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
       |
    It's what we aim to do
        |
    Our name is our virtue

[Chorus/Outro]
        G           D Dsus4
    But I won't hesitate
                Em
    No more, no more
              C            G
    It cannot wait; I'm yours
                                         D
    Well, open up your mind and see like me
                 D                      Em
    Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                             C
    Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
       G
    So please don't, please don't, please don't
               D        Dsus4
    There's no need to complicate
               Em
    'Cause our time is short
                                  C
    This oh, this oh, this is our fate
            A7
    I'm yours
