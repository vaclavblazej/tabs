[Intro] - - - -
    Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
    Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
    And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
                               Em
    Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Melody]

[Verse 1]         Em     G
    If this is to end in fire
                   D        C
    Then we should all burn together
              Em           G    D        Am7
    Watch the flames climb high into the night
            Em    G         D            C
    Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
              Am7         G/B           C
    Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Melody]

[Verse 2]
    And if we should die tonight
    Then we should all die together
    Raise a glass of wine for the last time
    Calling out father, oh, prepare as we will
    Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
    Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
    Now I see fire,   inside the mountain
    I see fire,   burning the trees
    And I see fire,   hollowing souls
    I see fire,   blood in the breeze
    And I hope that you'll remember me

[Verse 3]
    Oh, should my people fall   Then surely I'll do the same
    Confined in mountain halls   We got too close to the flame
    Calling out father, oh, hold fast and we will
    Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
    Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
    Now I see fire,   inside the mountain
    I see fire,   burning the trees
    And I see fire,   hollowing souls
    I see fire,   blood in the breeze
    And I hope that you'll remember me

[Bridge]       Am7      Em
    And if the night is burning
           G        D
    I will cover my eyes
               Am7    Em
    For if the dark returns then
       G             D
    My brothers will die
               Am7            Em
    And as the sky is falling down
               G                D
    It crashed into this lonely town
                  Am7
    And with that shadow upon the ground
      G/B     C                D
    I hear my people screaming out

[Chorus]
    Now I see fire,   inside the mountain
    I see fire,   burning the trees
    And I see fire,   hollowing souls
    I see fire,   blood in the breeze

    I see fire, oh you know I saw a city burning (fire)
    I see fire, feel the heat upon my skin (fire)
    And I see fire, oooooo (fire)

    And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
