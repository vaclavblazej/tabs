[Verse]

D              C            G       D         C                  A
Are you gonna take me home tonight?, Ah down beside that red firelight?
D              G
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
              D                  A                 D
Fat bottomed girls You make the rockin' world go round

           D
Hey I was just a skinny lad, Never knew no good from bad
                                  A
But I knew life before I left my nursery
       D                               G
Left alone with big fat Fanny, She was such a naughty nanny
           D              A              D
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me
Hey hey!

          D
I've been singing with my band, Across the wire across the land
                                    A
I seen ev'ry blue eyed floozy on the way
             D                                   G
But their beauty and their style, Went kind of smooth after a while
         D            A              D
Take me to them dirty ladies every time


[Chorus]

D              C            G       D         C                  A
Oh won't you take me home tonight?, Oh down beside that red firelight?
D          G
Oh and give it all you got
              D                  A                 D
Fat bottomed girls You make the rockin' world go round
              D                  A                 D
Fat bottomed girls You make the rockin' world go round


[Verse]

Hey listen here
D
Now your mortgages and homes, I got stiffness in the bones
                                A
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you)
         D
Oh but I still get my pleasure
        G
Still got my greatest treasure
           D              A              D
Heap big woman you made a big man out of me
Now get this


[Chorus]

D              C            G       D         C                  A
Oh won't you take me home tonight?, Oh down beside that red firelight?
D             G
Oh you gotta let it all hang out
              D                  A                 D
Fat bottomed girls You make the rockin' world go round
              D                  A                 D
Fat bottomed girls You make the rockin' world go round
