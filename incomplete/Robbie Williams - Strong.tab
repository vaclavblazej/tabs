[Intro]
    D - G6i - Em7 - (Asus4 - A - Asus2) - A -
    D - E7 - G - (A7sus4 - A7 - A7sus2) - A

    D
       My breath smells of a thousand fags -
         G6
    And     when I'm drunk I dance like me Dad
          Em7                             Asus4      A - Asus2 - A
    I've      started to dress a bit like        him
         D
    And    early morning when I wake up
       G6
    I     look like Kiss but without the make-up
         Em7                                      Asus4        A - Asus2 - A
    And      that's a good line to take it to the       bridge

    Em7                                         Bm
         And you know, and you know - 'cause my     life's a mess
    Em7
         And I'm trying to grow, -
             A7sus4           A7       A7sus2             A7
    So be -         fore I'm      old         I'll con -     fess


[Chorus]
    D                      E7
       You think that I'm     strong, -
            G                 Asus4        A - Asus2 - A
    You're     wrong, you're        wrong
    D                E7
       I'll sing my     song, -
       G             A7sus4        A7 - A7sus2 - A
    My     song, my         song


        D
    My    bed's full of takeaways,
        G6
    And      fantasies of easy lays
         Em7                                    Asus4      A - Asus2 - A
    The      pause button's broke on my vide -         o.
         D
    And     is this real? 'Cause I feel fake,
    G6
       Oprah Winfrey, Ricki Lake
    Em7                                  Asus4       A - Asus2 - A
        Teach me things I don't need to        know

    Em7                                          Bm
         And you know, and you know - 'cause my      life's a mess
    Em7
         And I'm trying to grow, -
              A7sus4          A7         A7sus2             A7
    So be -         fore I'm      old           I'll con -     fess


[Chorus]
    D                      E7
       You think that I'm      strong, -
            G                 Asus4         A - Asus2 - A
    You're     wrong, you're         wrong
    D                E7
       I'll sing my     song, -
        G            A7sus4        A7 - A7sus2 - A
    My     song, my          song


[Inter]
          C
    If I    did it all again I'd be a nun
         G6
    The     rain was never cold when I was young
               Em                             Eb - E - F# - G
    I'm still      young, we're still young
    Am
        Life's too short to be afraid
    Gi        D/F#        Em        D       D
        Step        in -      side     the    sun

         And you know, and you know - 'cause my      life's a mess
    Em7
         And I'm trying to grow, -
    F6                 Cadd9
       (Aaah pah pah          Aaah pah pah) Heey hey

    You don't have to take the blame)
