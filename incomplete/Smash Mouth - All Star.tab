[Verse] G D Am C
    Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
    I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
    She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
    In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

    Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun
    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

    So much to do so much to see
    So what's wrong with taking the back streets
    You'll never know if you don't go
    You'll never shine if you don't glow
[Chorus]
    |G                  C                  |C#b5       C|
    Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
    |G                  C                 |C#b5        C|
    Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
        |G        C         |C#b5 C|             
    And all that glitters is gold
           |G     F      | C         |
    Only shooting stars break the mold
[Verse]
    It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
    You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
    But the meteor men beg to differ
    Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

    The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
    The waters getting warm so you might as well swim
    My world's on fire how about yours
    That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

[Repeat Chorus]
[Whistling Verse]
[Repeat Chorus (skip 8 last beats, very swag)]

[Verse] G D Am C
    Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
    I need to get myself away from this place
    I said yep what a concept
    I could use a little fuel myself
    And we could all use a little change

    Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun
    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

    So much to do so much to see
    So what's wrong with taking the back streets
    You'll never know if you don't go
    You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Repeat Chorus]
