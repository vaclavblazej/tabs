[Intro] Am
    This is the greatest and best song in the world...   Tribute.

[Verse 1] Am
    Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
    We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
    All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon...
    In the middle of the road.
    And he said:

    A5
    "Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your souls."

    Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
    And we each said...   "Okay"

    Am                                 G
    And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
    F
    Just so happened to be,
    Am                   G             F
    The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.

[Chorus 1]
    D                          F
    Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
            C                     G
    One and one make two, two and one make three,
            F
    It was destiny.
    D                           F
    Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
             C                      G
    When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
             F
    And the grass don't grow...

[Verse 2] Am
    Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
    Whip-crack went his schwumpy tail,
    And the beast was done.
    He asked us: "Be you angels?"
    And we said, "Nay. We are but men!" ROCK!

[Interlude]
    D     F     C       G
    Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,
    F
    Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!

[Chorus 2]
    Am               G                   Am
    This is not The Greatest Song in the World.
    Am                 G        Am
    No, this is just a tribute.
    Am                    G                    Am
    Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World.
    Am            G        Am
    No, this is a tribute, oh.

    Am G               D           F
       To The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
    Am G                   D           F
       It was The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
    Am         G
    It was the best muthafuckin' song
    D                        F
    The greatest song in the world.

[Interlude]
    Am               G
    And the peculiar thing is this my friends:
    D                        F
    The song we sang on that fateful night,
    Am                       G                  D      F
    It didn't actually sound anything like this song.

[Verse 3]
                   Am           G           D      F
    This is just a tribute! You gotta' believe me!
                        Am      G                 D      F
    And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.
              Am        G
    Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin',
    D                    F
    So surprised to find you can't stop it.
    Am                   G
    Oh hallelujah, I'm found
     D                   F
    Rich motherfucker, ka-chug!

[Outro]
    E      F       E         F
              All right!
    E      F       E         F
