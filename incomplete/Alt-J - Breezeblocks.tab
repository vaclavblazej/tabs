For anyone wanting to change the E from minor to major, the actual notes played are (without capo)
bass A, melody C = Am, that's Em with capo - it's minor!!


[Verse 1]

C                   Em
She may contain the urge to run away
             Am
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
C                   Em
Citrezene your fever’s gripped me again
       Am
Never kisses all you ever send are fullstops - la la la la

C           Em
Do you know where the wilds things go
Am
They go along to take your honey - la la la la
C                            Em
Break down now weep build up breakfast now
                     Am
Let’s eat my love my love love love - la la la la


[Chorus]

F                    C
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
Em                         Am
The fear has gripped me but here I go
F                 C
My heart sinks as I jump up
Em                      Am
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
C    Em   Am   C         C    Em   Am   C
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah – ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah


[Verse 2]

C           Em

They go along to take your honey - la la la la
C                                Em 
Break down let’s sleep build up breakfast now
                     Am
Let’s eat my love my love love love - la la la la

C                      Em
She bruises coughs she splutters pistol shots
             Am
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
C              Em                              Am
She’s morphine queen of my vaccine my love my love love love - la la la la


[Chorus]

F                    C
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
E                         Am
The fear has gripped me but here I go
F                 C
My heart sinks as I jump up
E                        Am
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
C    Em     Am   C       C    Em   Am   C
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah – ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah


[Verse 3]

C                   Em
She may contain the urge to runaway
             Am
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
C         Em                            Am
Germaline disinfect the scene my love my love love love

Here the bass notes are (wo. capo) G to F, but I just can't find a good chord shape.
