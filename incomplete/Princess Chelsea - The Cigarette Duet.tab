[guitar Intro]

[Verse 1 -- female starts]
         Am         E              F              C
    It's just a cigarette   and it cannot be that bad
    Am               E               F                C
    Honey, don't you love me and you know it makes me sad?
         Am         E                F              C
    It's just a cigarette   like you always used to do
    Am              E             F               C
    I was different then, I don't need them to be cool

[Interlude]
    E E Am Am  [3x]
    E E Am E

[Verse 2 -- male starts]
         Am         E              F                 C
    It's just a cigarette   and it harms your pretty lungs
               Am           E               F             C
    Well, it's only twice a week so there's not much of a chance
         Am         E             F            C
    It's just a cigarette,  it'll soon be only ten
    Am             E                F              C
    Honey, can you trust me, when I want to stop I can

[repeat Interlude]

[Verse 3 -- female starts]
         Am         E                F              C
    It's just a cigarette   and it's just a Malboro Light
    Am    E            F              C
       Maybe but is it worth it if we fight?
         Am         E              F              C
    It's just a cigarette   that I got from Jamie-Lee
              Am          E              F             C
    Oh, she's gonna get a smack  and I'm gonna give you three

[Verse 4 -- both sing different text]
    [female voice]
             Am         E           F           C
        It's just a cigarette and I only did it once
             Am           E               F             C
        It's only twice a week so there's not much of a chance
             Am         E             F            C
        It's just a cigarette and I'm sorry that I did it
        Am             E                F              C
        Honey, can you trust me, when I want to stop I can

    [male voice]
             |          |             |            |
        It's just a cigarette,  it'll soon be only ten
        |              |                   |             |
        It'll make you sick   girl there's not much of a chance
             |          |                  |              |
        It's just a cigarette,   you'll be sorry that you did it
