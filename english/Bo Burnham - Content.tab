[Verse]
    E                     E
    If you'd have told me   a year ago
         D                          A
    That I'd be locked inside of my home (Ah, ah, ah)
    E                      E
    I would have told you,   a year ago:
    D                           A
    "Interesting, now leave me alone"
    E                         E
    Sorry that I look like a mess (Ah, ah, ah)
    D                          A
    I booked a haircut, but it got rescheduled
    E                          E
    Robert's been a little depressed, no
    D                        A
    And so, today, I'm gonna try just
    -          E                    C#m
    Getting up, sitting down, going back to work
    D                             A
    Might not help, but still, it couldn't hurt
    -               E                        C#m
    I'm sitting down, writing jokes, singing silly songs
    D               A
    I'm sorry I was gone

    -                         E
    But look, I made you some content
    C#m                 D              A
    Daddy made you your favorite, open wide
                   E
    Here comes the content
    C#m              D              A   E
    It's a beautiful day to stay inside
