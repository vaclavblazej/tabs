[Intro]  G B C Cm  [repeat for the whole song]

[Verse 1]                |                              |
    When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eyes
                        |                         |
    You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
                     |                      |
    You float like a feather in a beautiful world
                 |                          |
    I wish I was special, you're so fucking special

[loud Chorus] |            |
    But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                             |               |
    What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

[Verse 2]              |                      |
    I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
                     |                      |
    I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
                  |                    |
    I want you to notice when I'm not around
                      |                     |
    You're so fucking special, I wish I was special

[loud Chorus] |            |
    But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                             |               |
    What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

[loud Bridge]   |                     |
    Oooh, oooh, she's running out the door...
    |                      |
    She's running out, she run, run, run...
    |     |
    Ruuuuuuuun...
    |     |
    Ruuuuuuuuuuun...

[Verse 3]              |                   |
    Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
                      |                     |
    You're so fucking special, I wish I was special

[Chorus]      |            |
    But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                             |               |
    What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
              |
    I don't belong here
