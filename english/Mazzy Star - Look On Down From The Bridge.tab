[Intro]  C G F C  [x2]

[Verse 1]
    C                     G
    Look on down from the bridge
                 F               C
    There's still fountains down there
    C                     G
    Look on down from the bridge
              F           C
    It's still raining up here
    Am                   F
      Everybody seems so far away from me
    Am               F                  C
      Everybody just want to be free

[Verse 2]              G
    Look away from the sky
           F                              C
    It's no different when you're leaving home
    C                         G
    I can't be the same thing to you now
          F          C
    I'm just gone, just gone
    Am            F
      How could I say goodbye?
    Dm            F          C     G     F    C
      How could I say goodbye? Goodbye

[Break]  C G F C  [x2]

[Verse 3]
    Am                          F                Am
       Maybe I'll just place my hands over you
                       F           C
    And close my eyes real tight
                         G
    There's a light in your eyes
            F              C
    And you know, yeah you know
    C                     G
    Look on down from the bridge
             F         C
    I'm still waiting for you

[Outro]
    Am F Dm F
    C  G F  C  [x2]
