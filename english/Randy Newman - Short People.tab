[Intro]  A F#m7 B7 E7sus4  [x2]

[Verse]
    A                F#m7        B7              E7sus4
    Short People got no reason. Short people got no reason.
    A                F#m7           B7    E7sus4
    Short people got no reason to li-ive.   They got

    A                A7/G
    little hands and little eyes
    D/F#                      F7
    They walk around tell-in' great big lies. They got
    A                A7/G
    little noses and tiny little teeth, they wear
    D/F#                    F7
    platform shoes on their nasty little feet. Well, I

[Chorus]
    A     F#m7    B7   E7sus4
    Don't want no short people   [x2]
    A     F#m7    B7   E7sus4        A
    Don't want no short people 'round here.

[Interplay]  A F#m7 B7 E7sus4

[Bridge]
    Dmaj7            A/C#             Bm7         D/E
    Short people are just the same as you and I  (A fool such as I)
    Dmaj7       C#m7               Bm7
    All men are brothers until the day they die
    D/E
    It's a wonderful world.
    A                F#m7    B7              E7sus4
    Short People got nobody. Short people got nobody
    A                F#m7       B7     E7sus4
    short people got nobody to lo-ove.   They got
    A                A7/G
    little baby legs and they stand so low
               D/F#                 F7
    You got to pick them up just to say hello. They got
    A                   A7/G
    little cars that go beep beep beep. They got
    D/F#                F7
    little voices going peep peep peep. They got
    A                         A7/G
    grubby little fingers and dirty little minds
    D/F#                  F7
    They're gonna get you every time, well I
    A     F#m7    B7   E7sus4
    Don't want no short people   (x2)
    A     F#m7    B7   E7sus4        A
    Don't want no short people 'round here.

[Outro]  A F#m7 B7 E7sus4  [5x]
