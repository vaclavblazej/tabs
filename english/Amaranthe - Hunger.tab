[verse]
   Em                                   C
    Hear me scream, it's unreal, what's inside of me
   Em                              C
    Broken bones and the code that hunts me
   Em
    I come home, I'm alone, is it gone
             C          D
    What I'm feeling is surreal

    World in flames, it's a chase, I'm a cornered man
    It's a pulse in my veins, no delays
    It's a rain, it's a chamber of dust
    As I'm viewing the plains

[pre chorus]
   C           D*
    A drop of blood
   Em                         D
    A flood of anger for old times
[chorus]
   Fm#      D         A            E
    Hunger - save me,  one world depending on me
   Fm#         E            D               E
    I have the force in me,  the truth will be revealed
   Fm#      D        A         E               D
    Higher - faster,  I am the fuel to set you free
   E
    I am your destiny

[interlude] Fm#

[verse]
    Inhumane, I'm ashamed in the pouring rain
    Disinform, set the norm, you're to blame
    Spin the wheel, break the seal to conceal
    That I'm finding it so real

    I'm ashamed, not the way that I want to be
    Have to bare my own soul, unveil me
    To discern it's my turn, have to learn
    I have to face it
