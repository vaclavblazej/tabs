[Verse 1] G F#m H7 Em D C D G Em A7 C G
    Yesterday
    All my troubles seemed so far away
    Now it looks as though they're here to stay
    Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
    Suddenly
    I'm not half the man I used to be
    There's a shadow hanging over me
    Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Bridge] F#m H7 [Em D C C/B] Am D G
    Why she had to go
    I don't know, she wouldn't say
    I said something wrong
    Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
    Yesterday
    Love was such an easy game to play
    Now I need a place to hide away
    Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Bridge]
    Why she had to go
    I don't know, she wouldn't say
    I said something wrong
    Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
    Yesterday
    Love was such an easy game to play
    Now I need a place to hide away
    Oh, I believe in yesterday
