[Verse]      C                 Am
    Now I've heard there was a secret chord
         C                    Am
    That David played, and it pleased the Lord.
        F                G               C       G
    But you don't really care for music, do you?
       C                   F.          G.
    It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
        Am              F
    The minor fall, the major lift
        G               E7          Am    Am
    The baffled king composing Hallelujah

[Chorus] F    F      Am   Am
    Hallelujah, Hallelujah
         F    F      C    G7   C  C
    Hallelujah, Hallelu-uuuu-ujah

[Verse]
    Your faith was strong but you needed proof
    You saw her bathing on the roof
    Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
    She tied you to a kitchen chair
    She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
    And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
[Chorus]

[Verse]
    You say I took the name in vain
    I don't even know the name
    But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
    There's a blaze of light in every word
    It doesn't matter which you heard
    The holy or the broken Hallelujah
[Chorus]

[Verse]
    I did my best, it wasn't much
    I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
    I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
    And even though it all went wrong
    I'll stand before the Lord of Song
    With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
[Chorus]
