[Intro] Am F C G [2x]
    Show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time
    And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach
    Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
    And as you step back into line, a mob jumps to their feet

[Pre-Chorus] Am F C G  F F D D  F F D D
    Now dance, fucker, dance man, he never had a chance
    And no one even knew it was really only you
    And now you steal away, take him out today
    Nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid

[Chorus] Am F C G [2x]
    With a thousand lies and a good disguise
    Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
    When you walk away, nothing more to say
    See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives

[Verse 2]
    Slowly out of line, and drifting closer in your sight
    So play it out, I'm wide-awake, it's a scene about me
    There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
    And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me

[Pre-Chorus]
    (+ trust deceived)

[repeat Chorus]

[Solo]

[Bridge]
    Now dance, fucker, dance, he never had a chance
    And no one even knew, it was really only you
    So dance, fucker, dance, I never had a chance
    It was really only you

[repeat Chorus]

[outro Chorus]
    Clever alibis, Lord of the Flies
    Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
    When you walk away, nothing more to say
    See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives
