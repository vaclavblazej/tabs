lyrics phrasing is very arbitrary, so they are writen synced with beats

[Intro]
    F F Dm G  Am Am/B Am/C Am/D
    F F Dm G  Am Am G G

[Verse] Am Em [3x],  Dm G
    Oh -
    life    is bigger
    It's bigger than you, and you are
    not me.   The lengths that I will
    go to,   The distance in your
    eyes,
    Oh no, I've said too
    much,    I set it
    up.

[Chorus]
    That's me in the
    corner,   that's me in the
    spot - light   Losing my re-
    -ligion.   Trying to
    keep  up  with you.   And I
    don't know if I can do it.
    Oh no, I've said too
    much,   I haven't said
    enough.

[Bridge]
      G                        F
    I thought that I heard you laughing,
      Dm             G         Am   Am/B   Am/C   Am/D
    I thought that I heard you sing.
    Am   F               Dm  G   Am     G
    I  think I thought I saw you try.

[Verse]
    Every Whisper   of every waking
    hour, I'm  choosing my con-
    -fessions,   trying to 
    keep  an eye of you   Like a
    hurt lost and blinded fool,  fool
    Oh no, I've said too
    much,    I set it
    up.
            Consider
    this,   consider this,
    The hint of a century,   Consider
    this:   the slip
    That brought me to my knees  failed.
    What if all these fantasies Come
    flailing around?   Now I've
    said   too much.

[pre-Chorus]
        C               Dm
    But that was just a dream,
    C               Dm
    That was just a dream.

[repeat Chorus and Bridge]
[chorus Ending]
        F               Dm   G
    But that was just a dream,
    Am   Am/B   Am/C   Am/D   Am
    Try, cry,   why,   try.
    F               Dm      G      Am             G
    That was just a dream,  just a dream,  just a dream, dream.
