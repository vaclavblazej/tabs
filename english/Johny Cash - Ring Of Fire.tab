[Intro]  G G C G G G G  [4x]

[Verse 1]
    G,        C'      G.     C' G
    Love is a burning thing
           G,      C'    G.    C' G
    And it makes a Fiery ring
    G,       C'   G.     C' G
    Bound by wild desire
    G.              D7      G
    I fell into the ring of fire

[Chorus]
    D7            C.              G.
    I fell into a burning ring of fire
           D7                 C.          G.
    I went down, down, down   and the flames went higher.
           G
    And it burns, burns, burns
   G'   D7/A'   G.
    The ring of fire  [2x]

    The taste of Love is sweet
    When hearts like ours meet

    Oh, but the fire went wild

    And it burns, burns, burns
    The ring of fire
    The ring of fire
    The ring of fire
    The ring of fire...
