[Intro] G G G G [2x]

[Verse 1]
        G  G       B7 B7
    So long   Goodbye
         Em               D
    I'll see you when I see you
            C                      Cm
    You can pick the street   I'll meet you
           G          B7 Em'
    on the other side

[Verse 2]
    D/F#   G  G      B7 B7
       So long   Goodbye
         Em             D
    Do I really have to finish?
         C              Cm
    Do returns always diminish?
          G               B7 Em'
    Did I say that right?

[Chorus]
         G G#dim Am       Em
    Does anybody want  to joke
    (I wanna hear you tell a joke)
                  F               C.    D.
    When no one's laughing in the background?
    G     Dm7     F      C.Bb
     So this  is how  it ends
    G    Dm7        Bb         Eb.   C.  G G G G
     I promise  to never go outside again

[Verse 3]
        G  G       B7 B7
    So long       Bye!
        Em            D
    I'm slowly losing power,
        C            Cm
    has it only been an hour?
             G              B7 Em'
    No, that can't be right

[Verse 4]
    D/F#  G  G      B7 B7
      So long   Goodbye
         Em            D
    Hey, here's a fun idea
              C            Cm
    How about I sit on the couch
                G             B7 Em'
    and I watch you next time?

[repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
    Em          Am
     Am I going crazy?
                 D
    Would I even know?
                             G.        Ebdim.
    Am I right back where I started 14 years ago?
    Em               Am
     Wanna guess the ending?
               D                         G.            Ebdim.
    If it ever does, I swear to God that all I've ever wanted was:
      Em                       Em
    A little bit of everything all of the time
    Am/C                 Am/C
     A bit of everything all of the time
    G                       G
    Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
    F#dim                        F#dim
    I'm finished playing and I'm staying inside
    C                  G                     D
     If I wake up in a house that's full of smoke
                   Em.            D.
    I'll panic, so call me up and tell me a joke
    C                G                     D
     When I'm fully irrelevant and totally bro-ken damn it
    Em.            Bm.
    Call me up and tell me a joke
    C        G
      Oh shit
    B7                         Em.       D.
     You're really joking at a time like this?

[Outro]
    G            Am
    Well, well   Look who's inside again?
    D                      Em.       D.
    Went out to look for a reason to hide again
    G            Am                 D
    Well, well   Buddy, you found it
        Ebaug  Em.           Ebaug.
    Now come   out with your hands up
          Cadd9.     Cm.
    We've got you surrounded
