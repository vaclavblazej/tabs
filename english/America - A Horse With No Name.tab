[Intro]
    Em Em D6/9 D6/9  [x2]

[Verse 1]
           Em                D6/9
    On the first part of the journey
          Em                 D6/9
    I was looking at all the life
               Em                   D6/9
    There were plants and birds and rocks and things
               Em                 D6/9
    There were sand and hills and rings
        Em                      D6/9
    The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
            Em            D6/9
    And the sky with no clouds
        Em                    D6/9
    The heat was hot and the ground was dry
            Em                D6/9
    But the air was full of sound

[Chorus]
                   Em9                          Dmaj9
    (You see) I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
            Em9                   Dmaj9
    It felt good to be out of the rain
           Em9               Dmaj9
    In the desert  you can remember your name
                  Em9                Dmaj9
    'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
    Em9         Dmaj9
    La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
    Em9         Dmaj9
    La, la, la lala la la la, la, la  [third time repeat and fade out]

[Verse 2]
          Em              D6/9
    After two days in the desert sun
        Em                D6/9
    My skin began to turn red
           Em               D6/9
    After three days in the desert fun
          Em                 D6/9
    I was looking at a river bed
            Em                 D6/9
    And the story it told of a river that flowed
            Em                  D6/9
    Made me sad to think it was dead

[repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3]
          Em                  D6/9
    After nine days I let the horse run free
               Em                   D6/9
    'Cause the desert had turned to sea
               Em                   D6/9
    There were plants and birds and rocks and things
               Em                 D6/9
    There were sand and hills and rings
        Em                         D6/9
    The ocean is a desert with its life underground
          Em               D6/9
    And a perfect disguise above
              Em            D6/9
    Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
            Em                  D6/9
    But the humans will give no love

[repeat Chorus]
