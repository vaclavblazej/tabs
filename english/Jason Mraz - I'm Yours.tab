capo 4


[Intro]  G D Em C  [repeats majority of the song]

[Verse 1]
         |
    Well you done done me an' you bet I felt it
      |
    I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
      |
    I fell right through the cracks
                |
    And now I'm tryin' to get back

           |
    Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin it my bestest
        |
    and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
      |
    I reckon it's again my turn
       |
    To win some or learn some

[Chorus]
        |           |
    But I won't hesitate
                |
    No more, no more
              |            G   D   Em   C
    It cannot wait; I'm yours

[Verse 2]
    |                                    |
    Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                       |
    Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                         |
    Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love

    |                                                   |                            |
    Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
                                          |                           A7/C#
    And it's our god-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

[Chorus]
       |           |
    So I won't hesitate
                |
    No more, no more
              |
    It cannot wait, I'm sure
               |             |
    There's no need to complicate
                |
    Our time is short
                |
    This is our fate,
             |
    I'm yours

[Bridge]
    G                     D/F#          Em
    Doo do do doo doo do, doo do doo do doo do
                           D               C            C
    Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
                           A7/C#  -
    And I will nibble your ear

    G D/F# Em D C C A7/C# -

[Verse 3]
                       |
    I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
        |
    And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
        |
    But my breath fogged up the glass
             |
    And so I drew a new face and I laughed
      |
    I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
       |
    To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
       |
    It's what we aim to do
        |
    Our name is our virtue

[repeat Chorus] no chords

[Outro]
    But I won't hesitate
    No more, no more             G
    It cannot wait; I'm yours
                                         |
    Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                        |
    Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                             |
    Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
       |
    So please don't, please don't, please don't
               |
    There's no need to complicate
               |
    'Cause our time is short
                                  |
    This oh, this oh, this is our fate
            A7
    I'm yours
