[Intro]  D D
[Verse 1]
        D                 F#m
    And now,   the end is near
             F#m7             H7
    And so I face   the final curtain
       Em                    Em7
    My friend,   I'll say it clear
                  A7                   D
    I'll state my case,   of which I'm certain
         D                     D7
    I've lived   a life that's full
               G                Gm
    I traveled each  and  every highway
       D                      A7
   And more,   much more than this
              Em   D
    I did it  my   way

[Verse 2]  D F#m F#m7 H7  Em Em7 A7 D  D D7 G Gm  D A7 Em D
    Regrets,   I've had a few
    But then again,   too few to mention
    I did  what I had to do
    And saw it through   without exemption
    I planned   each charted course
    Each careful step   along the byway
    And more,   much more than this
    I did it  my   way

[Verse 3 intense]
                    D                     D7
    Yes, there were times,   I'm sure you knew
               G                 G
    When I bit off   more than I could chew
             Em                  A7
    But through it all,   when there was doubt
           F#m7            Bm
    I ate it up   and spit it out
               Em                 A7
    I faced it all,   and I stood tall
               G    D
    And did it my   way

[Verse 4]  D F#m F#m7 H7  Em Em7 A7 D  D D7 G Gm  D A7 Em D
    I've loved,   I've laughed and cried
    I've had my fill,   my share of losing
    And now,   as tears subside
    I find it all   so amusing
    To think   I did all that
    And may I say,   not in a shy way
    Oh no,   oh no not me
    I did it my   way

[Verse 5]  D D7 G G  Em A7 F#m7 Bm  Em A7 G D
    For what is a man,   what has he got?
    If not himself,   then he has naught
   To say the things   he truly feels
    And not the words   of one who kneels
    The record shows   I took the blows
    And did it  my   way

[Instrumental]

[Outro]  D A7 Em D
    Yes, it was my way
