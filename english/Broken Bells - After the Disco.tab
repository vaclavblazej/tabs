[Intro] Bm  Bm A E [2x]

[Verse]        Bm
    After your faith has let you down
                  A            E
    I know you'll want to run around
                   Bm
    And follow the crowd into the night
                  A                E                 Bm
    But after the disco all of the shine just faded away
                             A                 E
    Oh oh oh oh, do what you want, do what you will
                       D
    Don't tell me it's not our time

[Chorus]      B
    Cause I'm waiting here much too long and
    G             A               
    Don't assume, that I need your 
    B
    love. The chill of night has got you dancing away and I'm
    G                A
    Not the dreamer, or the dream you're
    Em
    Out there looking for
    Bm                    A               E
    How did I get in this winding maze of love?
                Bm
    And there's something wrong and it's sending you
    A                      E
    round and round til we go nowhere

[Instrumental] Bm Bm A E [2x]


[Verse]       Bm
    I see the ashes on the ground
               A                E
    I know the world is burning down
                  Bm
    And under the cold and empty moon
                  A                E                 Bm
    But after the disco all of the shine just faded away
                             A                 E
    Oh oh oh oh, do what you want, do what you will
                                                A                 E
    But you can't hide oh oh oh oh, do what you want, do what you will
                       D
    Don't tell me it's not our time

[repeat Chorus]
