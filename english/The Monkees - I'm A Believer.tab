[Verse 1]
    G                  D            G          G
    I thought love was only true in fairy tales
    G                 D                G  G
    Meant for someone else but not for me
    C               G         C                 G
    Love was out to get me,   that's the way it seemed
    C               G              D      -
    Dissappointment haunted all my dreams

[Chorus] G C [8x]
                   |
    Then I saw her face
                |
    Now I'm a believer.
          |
    Not a trace
                   |
    Of doubt in my mind.
           |
    I'm in love   (ooooooaaaahhh)
            |                   F               D     -
    I'm a believer,  I couldn't leave her  if I tried

[Verse 2]
    |                  |              |             |
    I thought love was more or less a given thing
    |                |                |   |
    Seems the more I gave  the less I got
    |                 |
    What's the use of trying
    |              |
    All you get is pain
    |             |              |    |
    When I wanted sunshine I got rain

[repeat Chorus]

[Interplay]

[end of Verse 1]
    C               G         C                 G
    Love was out to get me,   that's the way it seemed
    C               G              D      -
    Dissappointment haunted all my dreams

[2x repeat Chorus]
    ...
    Of doubt in my mind.
    I'm a believer, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahhaah....
    IÂ´m a Believer (x2)
