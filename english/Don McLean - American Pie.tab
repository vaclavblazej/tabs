[Verse 1]
      G.    D.   Em
    A long, long time ago,
    Am            C                Em            D              D
    I can still remember, how that music used to make me smile.
        G.        D.       Em           Am                 C
    And I knew if I had my chance, that I could make those people dance,
        Em              C           D      D
    and maybe they'd by happy for a while.
    Em            Am             Em                Am
     But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver.
    C.       G.     Am          C             D
    Bad news on the doorstep; I couldn't take one more step
      G.      D.     Em                 Am             D
    I can't remember if I cried, when I read about his widowed bride;
    G.        D.         Em               C       D7    G
    something touched me deep inside, the day the music died.

[Chorus]
       G    C        G        D
    So bye, bye Miss American Pie
             G            C             G         D
    Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
             G        C                  G           D
    And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
            Em'                         A7'   Em'                         D'  D
    Singin' this will be the day that I die,  this will be the day that I die

[Verse 2]
    G                 Am                   C                 Am
    Did you write the book of love, and do you have faith in God above,
    Em            D           D         G     D        Em
     if the Bible tells you so?  Now do you believe in rock and roll,
        Am              C                 Em                      A7         D     D
    can music save your mortal soul?  And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
           Em'                 Am'                     Em'             A'
    Well I know that you're in love with him, 'cause I saw you dancing in the gym
        C.   G.              A7           C                    D
    You both kicked off your shoes, man I dig those rhythm and blues!
            G.     D.      Em                     Am                   C
    I was a lonely teenage bronching buck, with a pink carnation and a pick-up truck.
          G.   D.    Em              C        D7    G.   C.G.        D7
    But I knew I was out of luck the day, the music died.  I started singin'

[repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3]
            G                     Am              C                   Am
    Now for ten years, we've been on our own; and moss grows fat on a rolling stone,
        Em                D       D             G.     D.           Em
    but that's not how it used to be.  When the jester sang for the King and
                Am               C                      Em                   A7      D  D
    Queen, in a coat he borrowed from James Dean, and a voice that came from you and me
            Em'                Am'               Em'              Am'
    Oh, and while the king was looking down, the jester stole his thorny crown;
        C.         G.    A7          C             D7
    the court room was adjourned, no verdict was returned.
              G.     D.     Em                Am                C
    And while Lennon read a book on Marx, the quartet practiced in the park;
        G.      D.     Em               C       D7    G.   C.G.      D7.
    and we sang dirges in the dark, the day the music died,  we were singing

[repeat Chorus]

[Verse 4]
    G              Am                         C                     Am
    Helter skelter in the summer swelter, the birds flew off with a fallout shelter;
    Em                           D    D    G.     D.   Em
    eight miles high and falling fast.  It landed foul on the grass,
        Am                  C                      Em                      A7   D    D
    the players tried for a forward pass; with the jester on the sidelines in a cast
        Em                Am                       Em                 Am
    The half time air was sweet perfume, while the sergeants played a marching tune;
       C.      G.    A7            C             D7
    we all got up to dance, but we never got the chance. 'Cause
        G.      D.       Em                      Am              C
    the players tried to take the field, but the marching band refused to yield
       G.    D.        Em                C       D7    G.   C.G.         D7
    Do you recall what was revealed, the day the music died?  We started singing

[repeat Chorus]

[Verse 5]
            G                 Am              C          Am
    Oh, and there we were all in one place, a generation lost in space;
         Em                      D    D             G.      D.      Em
    with no time left, to start again.  So come on, Jack be nimble, jack be quick,
    Am                  C                  Em           A7           D      D
    Jack flash sat on a candlestick, 'cause fire is the devil's only friend.
        Em'              Am'              Em'                    Am'
    And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage.
       C.    G.      A7          C                  D7
    No angel born in hell, could break that Satanâ€™s spell
               G.             D.     Em               Am             C
    And as the flames climbed high into the night, to light the sacrificial rite;
          G.    D.       Em                C       D7    G.  C.G.      D7
    I saw Satan laughing with delight, the day the music died. We were singing

[repeat Chorus]

[Verse 6 calm]
      G.    D.       Em
    I met a girl who sang the blues,
      Am                 C               Em                  D
    I asked her for some happy news; but she just smiled and turned away.
    G.     D.          Em                    Am              C
    I went down to the sacred store, where I heard the music years before,
            Em                 C              D    D
    but the man there said the music wouldn't play.
        Em                 Am                     Em                   Am
    And in the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed.
        C.    G.       Am          C                     D
    But not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken.
            G.        D.  Em             Am                  D
    And the three men I admire most: the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
    G.              D.         Em                C        D7    G
    They caught the last train for the coast the day, the music died.
    -
    And they were singin'

[repeat Chorus]

[last Chorus]
       G    C        G        D
    So bye, bye Miss American Pie
             G            C             G         D
    Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
             G        C                  G           D
    And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
            C                D7         G   C   G
    Singin' this will be the day that I die.
