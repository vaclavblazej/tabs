capo 4


[Verse 1]
        Am                   F
    The last   that ever she saw him
    G                   C.        G.
    Carried away   by a moonlight shadow
       Am                    F
    He passed on worried and warning
    G                   C.        G.
    Carried away   by a moonlight shadow.

    C                    G
    Lost in a river last saturday night
    Am.  F.         G
    Far away on the other side.
           C                         G
    He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
            Am.           F.          G
    And she couldn't find how to push through

[Verse 2]
    The trees that whisper in the evening
    Carried away   by a moonlight shadow
  Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
    Carried away   by a moonlight shadow

    All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
    Far away on the other side.
    He was shot six times by a man on the run
    And she couldn't find how to push through

[Bridge]
    G.  C' G.    C' G.
        I stay   I pray
           C.     F.    G
    I see you in heaven far away
    G.  C' G.    C' G.
        I stay   I pray
           C.     F.    G
    I see you in heaven One day

[Verse 3]
    Four am in the morning
    Carried away   by a moonlight shadow
    I watched  your vision forming
    Carried away   by a moonlight shadow

    Star was light in a silvery night
    Far away on the other side
   Will you come to talk to me this night
   But she couldn't find how to push through

[repeat Bridge]

    -
    Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
    -
    The night was heavy but the air was alive
    But she couldn't find how to push through

[Outro]
    Carried away by a moonlight shadow
    Carried away by a moonlight shadow
    Far away on the other side.
