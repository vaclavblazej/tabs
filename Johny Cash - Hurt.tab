[Verse] Am C D
    I hurt myself today
    To see if I still feel
    I focus on the pain
    The only thing that's real

    The needle tears a hole
    The old familiar sting
    Try to kill it all away
    But I remember everything

[Chorus] G Am F C
    What have I become
    My sweetest friend
    Everyone I know
    Goes away in the end

    And you could have it all
    My empire of dirt
    I will let you down
    I will make you hurt

[Verse]
    I wear this crown of thorns
    Upon my liars chair
    Full of broken thoughts
    I cannot repair

    Beneath the stains of time
    The feelings disappear
    You are someone else
    I am still right here

[Chorus]
    What have I become
    My sweetest friend
    Everyone I know
    Goes away in the end

    And you could have it all
    My empire of dirt
    I will let you down
    I will make you hurt

    If I could start again
    A million miles away
    I will keep myself
    I would find a way
