[Intro]

C G F C F C D7 G  C G F C  F G C   G

[Verse 1]

     C      G          F    C
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
    F       C              D7 G
The regular crowd shuffles in
           C       G       F       C
There's an old man sitting next to me
       F           G         C   G
Making love to his tonic and gin

          C            G         F   C
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory
    F          C           D7  G
I'm not really sure how it goes
         C            G           F          C
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
     F        G             C
When I wore a younger man's clothes."

[Interlude]

Am              D7
la la la, di da da
Am           D7    G  F C G7
La la, di di da da dum

[Chorus]

C         G                F     C
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
F         C      D7   G
Sing us a song tonight
            C          G          F   C
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
    F                 G         C     G
And you've got us all feeling alright

[Verse 2]

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke and he'll light up your smoke
But there's some place that he'd rather be

He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

[Interlude]

la la la, di da da
La la, di di da da dum

[Verse 3]

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessman slowly gets stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinking alone

[Chorus]

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us all feeling alright

[Verse 4]

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
To forget about life for a while

And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"

[Interlude]

la la la, di da da
La la, di di da da dum

[Chorus]

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us all feeling alright
