[Solo]

[Chorus]
    Color coded just to keep me sane
    My world is finally starting to take shape
    I press the button and it bursts into life
    This time, nothing will escape my sight

    I see the stars and the planets soon follow
    Expect to have the universe by tomorrow
    Just sit back and relax, don't worry
    The world can wait, no need to hurry
[Verse]
    Getting harder to stay in control
    But perfection is my only goal
    Have to fight it cause I won't go back
    I'd rather see the whole world go back to black

    But then I'm blinded by this light from nowhere
    This blue planet with life and an atmosphere
    I look closer and I can't believe
    What I'm seeing down there, is me

[Bridge]
    But if it's me looking down on me
    The world above must also be
    This could go on for infinity

[Chorus]
[Solo]
